# Schauway - a look away reminder tool

## Description

This tool can be used to remind yourself that you were absorbed in coding for the past **20 minutes** and that you should **look away** (schau weg) for **20 seconds** to relax your eyes a bit and increase the overall endurance when looking at screens for extended periods.

## How It Works

1. The tool starts in a hidden state.
2. After 20 minutes, it displays a fullscreen message: "Look Away" along with a reminder to focus on something 20 feet (6 meters) away.
3. The message stays on the screen for 20 seconds, encouraging you to relax your eyes.
4. The cycle repeats until you manually stop it using the provided "Stop" button.

## Installation and Usage

To use this tool, simply run the provided Python script. Ensure you have Python and Tkinter installed on your system.

## Credits

Recently in a Mobile Office training I read about the **20-20-20 rule** which can be used to prevent digital eye strain. It's difficult to remind yourself to look away because sometimes you might not even notice how much time passed. For me it's easier to have a tool remind and force me to take a brake from starring at my screen.

# Stehauf - a stand up reminder tool

Works quite similar to *Schauway* except it's not reminding you to look away but to stand up and use your stand-up work desk.

## How It Works

1. After 40 minutes sitting, a fullscreen message will tell you to "Stand Up".
2. To hide the Window you have to click the "Got it" button.
3. After 20 minutes standing, you will be told to "Sit Down" again.
4. Hide the window by clicking the Button.
5. The cycle repeats until manually stopped by the "Stop" button.
